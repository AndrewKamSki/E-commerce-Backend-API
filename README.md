  Once you have run the npm install, navigate to the db/ folder and open mysql. Run a 'SOURCE schema.sql;' in the console to initialize the database. Exit out of mysql, and navigate back to the main folder. There, seed the data by running a 'node seeds' to seed the database. Then run and npm start to initialize the program

  In insomnia, you can use the GET, POST, PUSH, and DELETE routes in the routes folder to receive, add new, update, and delete data
